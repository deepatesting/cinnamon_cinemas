# Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Seating Challenge
Test Driven Development exercise for Mars Rover.


### Your Task
**Setting the Scene**

You have a special task from Cinnamon Cinemas to develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theatre.
Cinnamon Cinemas provided some criteria for how the program should be built.

### Instructions

Read more [here](/docs/Cinnamon_Cinema_Task_Instructions.pdf) about the instructions to achieve this task.

### Hints

* Start with a failing test. This is a good Kata to practice TDD.
* Make your tests small in the beginning. Start with an empty String, then with Strings containing only one character. 
* After all cases have been fulfilled, start with multiple commands in the string.

### UnitTests

cd to the project root folder in the command line.

Run ``mvn test``
