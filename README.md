# Cinnamon Cinemas Movie Theatre Seating Challenge
Test Driven Development exercise for Mars Rover.


### Your Task
**Setting the Scene**

You have a special task from Cinnamon Cinemas to develop a program to allocate seats to customers purchasing tickets for a movie theatre.
Cinnamon Cinemas provided some criteria for how the program should be built.

### Instructions

Read [here](/docs/Cinnamon_Cinema_Task_Instructions.pdf) about the instructions in detail to achieve this task.

### Hints

* Start with a failing test. This is a good challenge to practice TDD.
* Make your tests small in the beginning. Start with testing empty string, then pass user input request. 
* Check for errors. Consider parameterized tests to test multiple cases.

### My Solution

* I have applied Test-Driven Development (TDD) to test-drive my solution. 
* Created Cinema class and CinemaTest class. Started writing test case with empty string return value check.
* Further test case written to check for valid number of rows, columns and user input.
* Included more methods in Cinema class to achieve seat allocation as per user request.

### TDD

cd to the project root folder in the command line.

Run ``mvn test``
